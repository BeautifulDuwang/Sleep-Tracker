# Sleep-Tracker
An app used to help you track, and impove, your sleep schedule.

The idea is that by inputting your age and weight, combined with using the app's feature to track hours of sleep, you can improve your sleep cycles.

It works by giving recommendations based upon the previous criteria.
The app tracks your sleep for a long period of time, but only displays the last 7 days for convenience.

It also allows the user to connect their account to their Google account, so they can transfer data to another device should they need to.
